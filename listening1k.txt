it does look a bit sore
i can walk to work
but my watch is five minutes fast
could i borrow it
we will go together on a walking tour of the city
could you spare some money
my throat hurts a lot
i have been out of touch with most of my old friends
so it has its problems
do you usually feel nervous
young man
look forward to seeing you
so why don't we take it easy this weekend
how much is enough
what do you ask her for
or he should get call waiting
let's go to prepare dinner
let me check the computer
are you going to teach
i would like to book a table please
includes the normal teaching hours
we will go on a picnic
be prepared to work very hard
i would move to the city instead of going to work by train every day
i started feeling sick
which rooms are they in
it should be clear by morning though
i suppose i could do that
we will be together forever
i don't know what else to say on the machine
you know i never realized how hard it is to run on sand
it sounds great
who is it from
i won't leave until nine
i like to exercise
we practice only one night a week
we have a lot of flowers
i think i should do that too
i will go to the gym
we will be going out then
how far is it from your school
what happened to you yesterday
i love snow
but i just don't have the money to do it right now
and i wrote him back this past weekend
i can't wait a month
but i am considering changing one for him
we live in the dormitory
i would miss my family
we like to eat vegetables
he started a business and he is now very rich
that movie looks so sweet
how many rooms has it got
don't tell me that you are buying another expensive computer
there is a really good film on at the cinema this week
that's very nice of him
you would better eat up quickly
he was supposed to meet me
but actually it isn't
i'm very glad that i have the chance to know about your work
not this time
you have still got lots of time
he is given up
we will be leaving from the parking lot
you don't go out to work
but in that case i will have to walk so long
what are you going to do with all that
stop and have a look at it
what i would like to know is how much it will cost to send a letter next month
do you go to work on foot every day
will we be allowed to take photographs
i used to take tennis lessons at the university once a week
can you tell us a little bit about where you have worked before
i have no idea about what will happen in the class and how i will get along with my classmates
i went abroad for my holiday
and to make matters worse
it's so beautiful
i would rather just have a cup of coffee
i know his secretary will have to take on most of his work while he is gone
can you tell me something about the two countries
ready for what
thank you and have a nice trip
why not join me in the swimming course tomorrow
don't say sorry
do you think i should call him
how would you like to pay for these
i'm here to see the cars
what kind of events do you organize
the boy over there
my watch is a little faster
did you grow up there
there are some goods of low quality of course
are you hurt
it is almost vacation time
housing office
he and some of his friends are getting a band together and they need a good singer
you don't understand
i have got to think about it seriously
he told me to lose some weight by taking less sugar and doing more exercise
you can buy them at the bookstore
six days
you are very welcome
i have packed everything
how are you getting along
tell people we are coming
jack failed again in the exam
do you eat any healthy food
what time do you close
i need your help
what makes you say that
and what a lot of relatives we have to think about
what is she wearing today
could do
is it very convenient for you to go to work or shopping
i will be back next weekend
you say you like watching and playing baseball
sounds like an interesting hobby
you hear all kinds of ideas
you bet you are
i have to admit i have been thinking about that
the last time i took this coach
it's lucky to have a good teacher
what about the window
i don't want you to lose the job or go without dinner because of a film
what's your problem
you can check it out
that will surely be helpful for a clean environment
look at this telephone bill
right now we are living with my wife's parents
and actually
he said there is nothing wrong with me
i know nothing more than playing computer games
before our music program at four
what are you going to do after you have finished
please tell me exactly how this happened
what's the rush
that sounds important
these two books are
in fact
about four days
it was almost over
let's go inside
it's interesting
what do you think about the conditions of home workers
i want to know the interest rate for the savings account
people live longer than ever before
i will tell him as soon as he comes back to the office
in case he wants to ring you
you have to be more careful next time
i feel like i will never get through everything
and now i feel like going into business for myself
but supper is ready now
i am looking forward to it
there is a conference going on in town and
we still can take her out for a big meal anyway
that could be almost anyone
if you think it will help
but i have to work
i have to finish this report this afternoon
it's moving very slowly
we will consider that later
we will look into it and call you back
i hope you can make it
how shall i find my way out
when i grow up
i haven't been to the seaside since i was little
hurry up
how's everything
i know where one is
i know he was often ill and he often got to work late
it's between the university and the supermarket
what's your room number
i have spare keys there
you miss it
is that possible to do that
why did you decide to give up your job
all i can do is to eat something and then go to bed
full board includes all meals
will you excuse me for a moment
please help me
we can also try new things
and what will the weather be like
but he makes me mad
i will make a note of that
now what's your name
i will find him
here are photos of the apartments
i know you are very busy now
i think you have got the flu
a lot of people do this these days
you are in excellent shape
and get some fresh air
that helped me a lot
do you mind if i join you
but i just can't spare the time
we will be lucky if we find a place to stand at this concert
although to start with i couldn't decide between that and geography
it shouldn't be allowed
why are you standing here in the cold wind
i will get you another copy
do you know those people over there
and in one way it isn't expensive at all
he is not in this morning
don't you like it
what do you want to see
i wonder if you can drop by tomorrow evening
where shall i put it
and they just want the same old music over and over to dance to
i would better take the bus home
of course i bought it here
and then i missed the bus
when you wash it
but our plane will take off in forty minutes
did she say anything
oh i almost forgot it
the records are over here on the shelf
there are two reasons
which opened three months ago
i will be expecting you then
if i let you out here
just ten minutes walk
she is
it's a quarter past twelve
don't you think his talk was boring
to be honest with you
do you like skating
i came here by bus
our university didn't have much money
how noisy outside
i'm enjoying all my classes
i didn't even wash up
so he gave me a discount
i seldom hear from anyone
he doesn't like it
would you like to join us
isn't it ever
they say they will give me a lot if i do well in the final exams
i will get some money out and we can have a drink
you are thinking about our summer vacation already
from half past nine to a quarter to twelve
are you seeing a film
i'm going in fall
are you sure that's the correct price
it's a three and a half hour drive
so how tall is the average woman
what did you learn
how is the jacket
i don't plan to be out much later
that's not too difficult
i just bring a day pack to school
just look it up
and going to parties
i'm very sorry about this
may i know what color you usually wear
this is where the wheat comes from
what about reading
you would better hurry
i have a dozen of them
there should be more traditional buildings
i am preparing for the final exams
i have to leave now
why not call them now
i don't think he will make a lot of noise every night
the engineer
i haven't heard the news
what time was the accident
what a lot of choices
you may go to the manager and ask him to have a talk with her
there must be something wrong with my learning
what's wrong with you today
this is his father
sorry about that
but in fact
if you can't return them on time
when do you want to leave for that seaside town
we could give her dinner somewhere
it's half past four
i will probably forget it
where would you like to work after graduation
that would be very nice of you
i was told it's going to be very difficult
have you registered for the classes you are going to take this term on the internet
have you got a set you can lend to me
i will try my best
it sounds wonderful
how much time do you spend exercising
let me look at the map
why didn't you stay in bed this morning
they don't quite agree with me
if you choose to rent one of them
the key
what's wrong with long hair
i think it is easy to be a strong player
it's nice to see you again
i give them a call right now
we will attend to it as soon as possible
not mean at all
may i check your luggage
that's a lot different
i have noticed that you haven't been looking so well lately
was the mid term exam difficult
he won't be able to arrive until the afternoon
wait right where you are
it's been nearly half a year since your last call
would you mind if i sat here for a moment
where are you living right now
if you don't understand it
in my opinion
so what are you worried about then
you know i am always fond of the subject
they have lived here for almost forty years
the dictionary
not often
yellow and orange
but i find the words difficult to remember
but i'm sure i can go with you next time
may i be of service
a patient has just come here
i will change it
it was supposed to be new
was he wearing glasses
it won't be long
i'm just calling to let you know that i will be a little late to the game tomorrow night
could you give me a hand
i would like to buy a bicycle as a present for my son
i learn of it
so you needn't take a lot of clothes if you don't plan to stay there long
and where do i get off the train
be careful when you cross the street
i would like you to
we even had a picnic on a small island
can i have a word with you
she said
how many people would you like to find at last
we recommend air transportation
can you give me a hand in the kitchen
let's take your temperature
i think it's something i ate
do you think he will be out for several days
and in the evening we can go and see a play
i see
no smoking is allowed in the lift
it has
you only need to put your watch ahead ten minutes every day
is there anything good on
but after work i often play some sports
and these are the books
so what kind of place are you looking for
i have already finished the exercises
and my voice was very clear too
it is on sale at one dollar fifty a pound
in half an hour
i can't stand it
it has three bedrooms and one bathroom
are there any game shows on now
i'm sure you won't have any trouble
he took the dog for a walk
sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed
are they cheap
i couldn't put up with my wife any longer
brown to call you as soon as the meeting is over
but you never travel for your job
what shall i bring
our town will become cleaner after the factory is built
she always says that
i'm well prepared for it
when i was a child
what time shall we go
i bought this hat
where were you
but what would you like to have
and i must have eaten something that didn't quite agree with me
working in sales now
something like that
i had a letter from her friend
but we don't have enough money at present
let's get down to business
do it with me now
what's that noise
is there anything else you would like to have
haven't i been looking well
i like singing very much
here is a ten dollar bill
if my customers are flying
and another six dollars
some poems about feelings
i have invited some friends over
take the dog for a walk
we have different kinds of chocolate for you to choose from
i have been walking in the rain
which subject are you least interested in
but my little brother likes it very much
i will get my battery here
what time do you start
i'm afraid you have the wrong number
it's the teaching center
that's so kind of you
if you are seriously hurt and alone
leave him to me
i was only interested in the two bedroom flat
not at this hour
but he hasn't turned up
and we can go to some other places as well
the one downstairs
why didn't you come today
if i can
it means bad luck
i don't know what you are talking about
you would better take one just in case
and me
today i forgot to give him an important message
but i don't know what time the banks close
we have already been behind schedule
i felt a bit better while i was watching
who is it
i spend most of my time studying
then i will be able to take part in the basketball match next month
how shall i cut it
because it's a school night
i wish you good luck
now this afternoon
no food is very effective
it was quite small
do you want to go out and get something to drink
i bought it because i like it
i have been here for twenty minutes already
just write your name and address here
do you mind if i take this seat
but didn't see you there
now it's our turn
you get out of your office and turn right
i will never get anything finished
what was it
i will take you there
and so is the music course
we would like to go there on a train
do you like this jacket
and that always makes a difference
there was one left on the counter yesterday
shall i buy it
was he or wasn't he
but things will get better
after coming home from my job i have to hit the books for a few hours every night
such a great idea to spend the weekend this way
i don't understand
sitting for too long without relaxing will make you feel very tired
could you tell me where you live
but i didn't see him leaving
here is the ticket
was the movie as good as you expected
of course i would like to
you should be careful with your health
that's a promise
there i read about your school
i can certainly go
why did you buy so many things when you have to walk home from the store
by train or by air
do you prefer brown meat or white meat
we will begin now
shall we go swimming this afternoon
but my brother is coming to see me
tonight at six is fine
but i won't be traveling by myself
there is a lot of smoke out here
how many pieces of baggage do you have in all
or at hotels near the sea
i am too tired and i want to do nothing but sleep
tickets are cheaper then
i don't know what i can get for your father
you may keep the change
i said that we must hurry because we are already late for the film
you have a very interesting name
if you wish
i will get it back
what are you working for
for which night
and nothing else
i can't stand this course any more
i had two tickets for the film and i wanted you to see it with me
better take the subway instead
it was a wonderful film
but quite different from the usual type
was i supposed to come to the meeting
i don't believe you
what are you doing here alone
i thought you said one book
they work to make money and to get on in the world
i love cars very much
ten stamps and five envelopes
but most people decide to have only one or two
and have you ever been to the theater
what's your name
we still have plenty of time
i want to talk to you about that noise
the literature essay is so boring
they are very interesting
and for old people
my right leg
i will work on my computer
i was a bit disappointed
keeping beautiful fish is very popular all over the world
you are going on a trip
she told me to call her when i got here and she would come to meet me
i like them very much
first question
could you possibly come home early
was the weather good
your party
that will be the best part
because there were too many people and too much pollution on the earth
what are you doing out here alone
do any other people in your family use the bus service
shall we say seven o'clock
what's it called
then make a list of ideas
i have a reservation here
so how often do you work out
besides all these
but i have decided to open a dance school once i'm over the top
but i can't find my exercise book anywhere now
i mean i won't be able to go tomorrow evening
i will lose my contact with students
i wonder if there is a service charge for our meal
would ten to one be convenient
in just three weeks
you mean you want me to go there with you
do you have any apartments available for under four hundred dollars a month
yesterday in class
i have tried my best to be pleasant
a red sweater over it
hold on
no problem at all
i'm working as a part time research assistant so that's no problem
right over there
it doesn't match
it took quite a while to find you
i wonder if you would let me know if there are any changes on that flight
what a long way
look who is here
but it has a large kitchen
so i would like to live in a house in the country built with earth
not even for one minute
but i didn't see any
but i can't read it because i'm not wearing my glasses
i have been very much into swimming these days
that's no help to me at all
i'm going to ask you a few questions
since i didn't really want to be at that school and i wasn't interested in my major anyway
i'm pretty busy these days
one o'clock sounds fine
where have you been staying
i thought you had already finished that
i decided to make new legs for myself
what was the best part of your holiday
mother could
the telephone isn't working
please take careful notes
tom speaking
we would like some fresh fruit
i hope you don't mind waiting while i get prepared
i like color photos
i would also like to get some information about the discount
i'm going to see the doctor
a sports magazine
after lunch
do you think you can make it this evening
let's take some flowers
but i tell you i didn't take it
i will move in tomorrow
i like it better
if you are sure
opera seems slow and boring
you are staying very close to your parents
were you
why don't you do that while i change my clothes
something in wool
she is not happy because she can't get along with the girls who share the dormitory with her
for one year
do you go to the cinema a lot at night
it must have been hard for you since you have to give them special attention in order to help them
i wouldn't have had so much trouble
but first of all we want to relax
are you there
can you surf
i noticed that you weren't there
you will be a very good swimmer
i have everything written out here
should i phone to see if they have a room for you
would you mind if i asked you to drop me off in front of the park
going to class
you are not happy
but considering the high quality
that sounds interesting
he is your son
and we have some other choices of savings deposit you can choose from
the kids
anything else
if i'm interested
i really love this campus
she isn't in the dormitory now
did you visit the places you wanted to see
i sleep late
and i was hoping i could come today to see the doctor
i wanted to stay longer
when are you coming
ten to six
but there is something wrong with it
you should have bought it earlier
good acting in opera
i sure am
people of different colors lived together
is there a bus to the city center
why not take her for a drive in the country
shall i put it on the bed
i would prefer to walk
for how many
when will the show begin
i enjoyed all the sports and i read a lot
she is an extremely good looking young woman
did you go for your interview yesterday
what should i do then
a taxi will take you there quickly and on time
you are the only person who knows what really happened
how long have you been here
i want to learn it well too but i find it too hard
when does the job start
and do you know how long it's open
let me finish the newspaper first
i often have meals at home on weekends
shall we have a special dinner
it seems to me that all the dishes are so good
the first answer is yes and the second answer is no
why get upset
did you enjoy your holiday in the country
i will give it another try
i doubt whether you can give it up in the end
i want to find out which schools are the most popular
leaving at the same time
see you around
the colour ran
i wouldn't say no to that
they are so lovely
how often do you write to your parents
how would you manage without me
it's always packed
you have to take the bus across the street
just stay inside and lock your door
it has been such a long time since we met
i have been really busy these days
we went there two days ago
don't you remember
i think i can wake up at the proper time and i won't be late for work
it turned out that the meeting ended early
just turn right
which city did you stay in then
how long does it take you to drive home
please give me your name and address so i can send an ambulance
i thought i would finish in about five minutes
it's my wallet
by train
about a year now
i wish i could get a job like that
it's about the same every day at this time
can you help her
good to see you could come a long way
there are three of us all together
what makes you unhappy
i don't like green or blue
i arrived at the company just in time as the train was about to leave
though it is still clear
i haven't found a summer job yet
who is that man sitting in the corner
sometimes i look up information i need for my job
maybe we can get together and go to the beach this summer since we will be living near each other
can you make it
does that include gas and electricity
when they realized that
what time does your dinner start this evening
and the big theatre
it includes everything except electricity
this is a chance not to be missed
very glad to meet you
have you had a chance to wear your new shirt yet
i have got a lot to do downtown today
i'm sure there will be a lot of guests there
but i'm quite sure there is something wrong with my stomach
and you are welcome to share your ideas with the class
it's a fine day for walking
but it's nearly full
but i don't even know what to study
but i don't think i will although i have a lot of time
will you please fix the button for me
it's seven
i had no idea you were coming
who is that man
so now you are the traffic police
i get it
how are they arranged
but it's so far
most newspapers
we can only stay home and wait for them
what's yours
we have to keep ourselves fit
about half an hour if there is no traffic jam
did you study for the exam
it seems that we will have to do some shopping tomorrow afternoon
you should take their advice
how are you feeling now
it used to be good
it will be very interesting and we will be able to travel around more easily when we are there
have you got any seats downstairs
i haven't seen the menu yet
here is the top ten
and i'm not afraid to say that i'm scared
you are very clever
it was just a month ago that i had it repaired
and some of the buses are very comfortable except the older ones
it's difficult to find a suitable job this year
but i really said the main entrance
you should pay extra for it
i like this style very much
more teachers will be wanted
so what happened
i'm too old for family holidays
no wonder the line was busy all the time
i have to meet my study group at the library in our school
what have you been doing these days
we have been trying to get tickets everywhere
and then they had a very difficult and dangerous journey home
what's her name
that's very important
i think green would be nice
but the fact is that we didn't have the money
it sounds a little bit difficult
it's closer to work
i am coming to that
tomorrow evening
you like the weather here
in the beginning we thought we would never get all arranged but now we are very comfortable
it's not your fault
how did you get here so fast
it was a complete surprise
his hair is fair
but he was afraid of what the boss would say
we will get there immediately
just sort of a day to day management
i think it's going to take a long time
there will be a lot more people here in about five years
we won't lend it out
towards the post office
i can mail them for you
and i would like to go with him
maybe we could try that here
it was there with the blue one the day before yesterday
then you can do it quickly
what made you change your mind
would you like to go with us
how long will it take to get there
that's quite easy
go this way along
just when students need help most we can't afford the time to get it
i would like to meet her at the airport
after dinner
but now i couldn't find the phone number
this morning
could you explain exactly what you do
your table is right here
and what about classical concert
i like some chicken
do you want to sign it
the brown one or the black and white one
the desert is nicer than you thought
but it's only for a few minutes
what kind of face does he have round or square or long
how much is a stamp
it seems that the public can't get enough of this kind of news
we will be able to go skating this weekend
dancing around in no time
let's go swimming
it's about history
have you decided yet
you call that singing
i'm just reminding you of the time
you can have the first month free
to italy
how can i get to school so soon
you would better
not yet
it's too bad that two people had similar problems in such a short time at the same restaurant
these shoes are very cheap
jim decided he would like to learn something new
what are we going to watch
let's leave the place
she has a hat on too
we have got about a quarter of a million miles of roads
there is an awful lot of work to do before that time
how much do you pay for rent
i like them over easy
i will be glad to work with you
i'm telling you why
i got it home but the thing simply doesn't work
you are always the best
you can watch on line after your work
why didn't you come this morning
but have you heard about third hand smoke
are you going straight home after school
that's all i can read
you can teach children how to study their lessons
i have never felt better
you have done that a hundred times
we have got all kinds of mobile phone here
i have a sister in college now
i hurt my back in the first half
i checked in about ten minutes ago
what else have i got to do
you are over an hour late
i would like to live somewhere a little further north or south from here
do as i tell you now
not very big
try it on first
i put into it everything kept in the refrigerator
that's not enough
just put it on the table
who are you talking with
i have been working on the problem for a long time
glad to meet you here
i don't want to trouble you
but it's my plan for the coming year
we can put it in our dining room
late as usual
how about a computer
i heard him going out a few minutes ago
i can hardly believe it's real
it has already killed lots of birds and animals
everyone on the plane died
didn't you even want to go to the cinema
are you interested in a part time job
there was still someone inside
and less dealing with students
she is studying for an exam
do you have it
it is too hot these days
what time do you want to leave
it is very comfortable
shall we go out for a walk
so i know the story very well
and i want to send it to my sister
maybe we should do something next weekend
we came too early
i don't think so
only my brother
let's meet at the gate of the theatre at seven
what kind of job
to the corner and then a left
take your umbrella with you
could you show us what you bought
can you spare me a few minutes
how long did you stay there
you should go forward to the main road ahead
enjoy the warm weather
but now it is gone
i would just not worry
and i am excited
what isn't there
but it's more of a dry cold
but they may not lend them to others
make sure you have a proper lunch
what about the children
one period before breakfast
what advice did she give you today
aren't they
let me give you a test
this week
that might have to come later
it sounds like checking in for a meeting
should i bring anything with me
you must have left the book in the taxi
how long does each class last
but i have lots of other things to do
could you really
very likely
but be quiet
and here i am
i believe
but now you do five hours every day
human power is just the power of a person
we will take those
how about coming out with me this evening
hill has left
i asked you not to tell any of our friends that i failed my class
when i turned on the washing machine
would it be better to stay in a hotel
i have lost my way
do you have a cheaper one
what date is it
remember to follow it carefully
i am afraid
does that mean you have to try harder to get customers
that's what we need
he is still in hospital
three dollars
about the bus service
that's where they first met
on average
may i have one
he is very responsible
but she lost the bill
doesn't it
another cup of coffee
i was there but i was standing with a large group and he didn't see me
there is plenty to do at home
do you like the acting
soup would be good
how long have you been living in that house
one has the right to keep a pet
how many students tried out for the basketball team this year
what should i do to stay in shape
look in your suitcase again
sometimes when the windows are open
but you just put on your clothes
what day is it
i'm in town for a meeting
so could you show me the flat for rent
don't you think that you did well
and you have the radio alarm next to that
for ten years
i also made a new friend there
what kind of work do you do
and i can't lift it myself
and we will catch the bus there
you will need to get this medicine
but sometimes it can't help
give me the number and i will try it for you
you can keep it as long as two months
it's far too long
is she all right
looking after my son and seeing him grow up are the most important things to me now
how are you going there
and what name
can i get something to eat on the train
how would you like your beef
but it's not just an excuse
i'm so glad to be invited
that's a surprise
so i took a day off
but the children
want to go for a swim
it's sunny and warm
but she is by no means a pleasant person to deal with
i'm going to the office
stay where you are
what's that over there
i'm sorry they are noisy
i will deal with this myself and i will have it sent up to your room right away
when will my car be fixed
just ten minutes' walk
now where is the menu
i am paid better than i was before
i suppose i took the job because
i can't find it now
just stay here
and what are your plans for the future
how long will you be staying
i have turned off the electricity and finished packing our clothes
is it this one
my wife will finish her movie in five minutes
i usually am
i hope i can find my passport somewhere in the hotel
i don't like football as well as basketball or volleyball
going home
how do you like living here
but if you run into something that you want to buy and have very little time
just a second
i think there is certainly something in it
it was easy to learn
he will be with you in a minute
so we shouldn't let them feel disappointed
where are you off to
when do you plan to leave
am i going the right way
maybe she forgot her watch
you will love the class
i will rent a small one for one day
i am fine
don't we
i'm getting off the bus
he is all excited about sports now
anyone i know
i would like to look at a dark business suit
i wonder when this wet weather will clear up
that reminds me
have you any working experience
how about having supper first
do you always lock the front door
you can't make them unhappy
which city do you like best
prepare the list
to make it easier for you
you sing
let me give them a call right now
